# Run Queries in HeatWave

## Introduction

HeatWave console provides a Query Editor to ease your interaction with the DB system eliminating the need to go back and forth between the Console and an external MySQL client for resource and data management.

_Estimated Time:_ 10 minutes

### Objectives

- Connect to the Starter DB System.
- Run queries with  HeatWave.
- Drop a table from the schema, airportdb.

### Prerequisites

## Task 3: Drop a table from the schema

Let us drop the table, <i>booking</i>, from the schema, <i>airportdb</i>. We will use Lakehouse to map the table from an Oracle-managed S3 bucket.

 1. Drop the table, <i>booking</i>, from the schema, <i>airportdb</i>, by running the following query in the **Query Editor**. 

    ```bash
    <copy>use airportdb;
    drop table booking;</copy> 
    ``` 
    ![Drop table booking](./images/8-drop-table-booking.png "Drop table booking")

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
